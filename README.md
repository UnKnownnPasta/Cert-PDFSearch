# Cert-PDFSearch
This is more of a personal project but the code is cool.

## How it works:
There's a folder (locally stored obv) that contains pdfs (1 page) which have text written in them (names)
This program can take the input of a name and return the exact pdf with that name written in it.

## Prerequisites
Needs:
  - PyPDF 3.0.1
  - tkinter (GUI)
  - pystray 0.19.4
  
## How to use 
### ~~noone would or has the use for this anyways~~
Just type in a name in the text field and click find. It'll give you the result at the top bar; if there's pdfs found then below the status bar will be the pdf name (which you can copy) and below that an option to download the file directly.

##### Note: Download currently doesn't work
